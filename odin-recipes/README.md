# odin-recipes
In this project, I built a simple recipe website called Odin Recipes. I started by creating an index.html file that will serves as the homepage for our website. Then, I created a recipe page for our first dish, and add a link to it on the homepage. The recipe page includes an image of the finished dish, a description of the recipe, a list of ingredients needed, and a set of steps for making the dish. I then repeated this process for two more recipes, creating a total of three recipes on my website.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate our proficiency in HTML, including creating an HTML document with the proper structure, adding headings, images, links, and lists, as well as organizing the files into directories. Additionally, I have practiced using Google or recipe websites to gather information and images for our website. Overall, this project is a great starting point for anyone interested in web development and looking to learn more about HTML.
